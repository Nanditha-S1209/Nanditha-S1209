## üóÇÔ∏è Highlight Projects

***Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-Project***

Real estate price prediction site using machine learning, built with Python Flask and linear regression. Uses the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. Users input home features for price predictions. Covers data cleaning, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning. Tools: Python, Flask, Sklearn, HTML, CSS, JS. Real Estate Price Prediction

This project series provides a comprehensive guide on building a real estate price prediction website using machine learning. The project utilizes the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle and walks through the step-by-step process of creating a model using sklearn and linear regression. The series includes the development of a Python Flask server to serve HTTP requests and a website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to allow users to input home square footage, number of bedrooms, etc., and obtain the predicted price by calling the Python Flask server.

Throughout the project, various data science concepts are covered, such as data loading and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, grid search CV for hyperparameter tuning, k-fold cross-validation, and more. The technologies and tools utilized in this project include Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The goal of this project series is to provide a practical and detailed walkthrough for individuals interested in learning about real estate price prediction and implementing machine learning models in a web application.

Technology and tools wise this project covers,

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
Python flask for http server
HTML/CSS/Javascript for UI
